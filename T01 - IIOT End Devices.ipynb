    "### IOT End Devices\n",
    "---\n",
    "- As mentioned already, the end devices are the ones which are interfaced closest to the sensors and the actuators.\n",
    "- The examples we discussed already are - \n",
    " 1. An Arduino interfaced to a sensor - Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) reading the analog voltage of an LDR voltage devider circuit.\n",
    " 2. An ESP8266 Wifi Module interfaced to an actuator - LED.\n",
    " \n",
    "###### We will try to understand and implement the first example -\n",
    "###### Components needed - \n",
    "---\n",
    " 1. Arduino Board\n",
    " 2. USB Cable to connect Arduino to a Computer \n",

    "- Read this to get a basic idea and get started with an Arduino - [Basic Arduino Tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoUno)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "###### Using Online Editor -\n",
    "1. Create an Arduino account here - [Arduino Web Editor](https://create.arduino.cc/editor)\n",
    "2. After creating your account and logging in, go to - [New Arduino Project](https://create.arduino.cc/editor)\n",
    "3. On the left sidebar of the page, select Examples -> Basics -> AnalogReadSerial\n",
    "4. Install the Arduino Create Agent Plugin for your OS, install and run the agent. Click the help option on the top of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Using Offline Editor -\n",
    "5. Alternatively, one can download the Arduino Software from [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and select Files -> Example -> Basics -> AnalogReadSerial.\n",

    "\n",
    "6. Change the delay function argument to 1000 at the bottom of the example code so that it reads **delay(1000);** and check if the example code compiles by clicking on the compile button (tick symbol)\n",
    "7. If the code compiles successfully, connect the Arduino Board to the USB port.\n",
    "8. Select the board model and the Serial port from under Tools -> Board and Tools -> Port\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Upload the code by clicking the upload button in the editor.\n",
    "10. After the code is uploaded, open the Serial Monitor from the Tools -> Serial Monitor\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Voltage sampled every second on the Analog pin of the arduino should be shown on the Arduino Serial Monitor, each in a new line.\n",
