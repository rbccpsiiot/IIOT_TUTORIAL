    "### IOT End Devices\n",
    "---\n",
    "- As mentioned already, the end devices are the ones which are interfaced closest to the sensors and the actuators.\n",
    "- The examples we discussed already are - \n",
    " 1. An Arduino interfaced to a sensor - Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) reading the analog voltage of an LDR voltage devider circuit.\n",
    " 2. An ESP8266 Wifi Module interfaced to an actuator - LED.\n",
    " \n",
    "###### We will try to understand and implement the first example -\n",
    "###### Components needed - \n",
    "---\n",
    " 1. Arduino Board\n",
    " 2. USB Cable to connect Arduino to a Computer \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Steps -\n",
    "---\n",
    "- Read this to get a basic idea and get started with an Arduino - [Basic Arduino Tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoUno)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "###### Using Online Editor -\n",
    "1. Create an Arduino account here - [Arduino Web Editor](https://create.arduino.cc/editor)\n",
    "2. After creating your account and logging in, go to - [New Arduino Project](https://create.arduino.cc/editor)\n",
    "3. On the left sidebar of the page, select Examples -> Basics -> AnalogReadSerial\n",
    "4. Install the Arduino Create Agent Plugin for your OS, install and run the agent. Click the help option on the top of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Using Offline Editor -\n",
    "5. Alternatively, one can download the Arduino Software from [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and select Files -> Example -> Basics -> AnalogReadSerial.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Compiling and Uploading the example code - \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Change the delay function argument to 1000 at the bottom of the example code so that it reads **delay(1000);** and check if the example code compiles by clicking on the **verify/compile** button **(tick symbol)**\n",
    "7. If the code compiles successfully, connect the Arduino Board to the USB port.\n",
    "8. If not automatically selected, select the board model (Arduino Uno) and the Serial port from under Tools -> Board and Tools -> Port\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Upload the code to the Arduino board by clicking the **upload button** (right next to the Verify/Compile button) in the editor.\n",
    "10. After the code is uploaded, open the Serial Monitor from the **Tools -> Monitor**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Voltage sampled every second on the Analog pin of the arduino should be shown on the Arduino Serial Monitor, each in a new line.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Also the TX LED on the Arduino can be seen blinking every 1 second indicating the analog value read is being transmitted over UART.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "###### This is a very simple implementation of an IIOT End Device.\n",
    "###### In the next tutorial, we will learn how this data from the end device reaches the IIOT Gateway."
